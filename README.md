# Climate Change National Safety Plan (CCNSP) - Storslysia Relocation Social Insurance Program
## Executive Summary
Our consulting firm has been hired to design a social insurance program for all residents of Storslysia, who are being affected by catastrophic weather events that are occurring with increased frequency as a result of climate change. This social insurance program called “Climate Change National Safety Plan (CCNSP)”, considers both voluntary relocation and involuntary displacement where: 

* Voluntary relocation is proactive relocation with residents moving out of regions that have been identified as having a high level of exposure to hazardous weather events in advance of catastrophic weather events. 
* Involuntary, or “emergency” displacement is reactive relocation caused by the occurrence of hazardous weather events. 
The program aims to reduce economic costs associated with relocation activities caused by disastrous weather events and ensure costs do not exceed 10% of Storslysia’s gross domestic product (GDP) each year.  

This report discusses the details of the CCNSP, namely: 
1. Descriptions of key features of the designed insurance program, particularly: 
    * Claim process;
    * Requirements for successful claim assessments for the population of Storslysia; 
    * Coverages provided by the program; 
    * Key metrics to be used to report and monitor the success of the program. 
2. Pricing and costs associated with the insurance program. 
3. Relevant assumptions used for analyses and financial modelling.  
4. Risks and risk mitigation strategies. 
5. Data limitations. 

This report will not be discussing the sources of funding or modelling for funding, as they will be covered separately by another taskforce from Storslysia’s government. 

## Section 1: Product Design
### Section 1.1: Claim Requirements
For a citizen of Storslysia to file a claim under Climate Change National Safety Plan (CCNSP), they must satisfy the following criteria:
* Have a permanent address in a region affected by the weather event.
* Be over the age of 18.
* Have quantifiable damage to the property and/or household goods.

The claim will be filed through the CCNSP webpage as part of the government website and the following details will be required from the claimant:  full name; age; address; number of household members; resident type (owner-occupied property or rental tenant); income of primary member; identification documents which clearly shows residential address; current market value of property; value of property damage with substantiation documents provided.

### Section 1.2: Coverages Provided Under the Program
In the event of a claim, provided an individual satisfies the above criteria, the following benefits and exclusions apply.

|Benefits/Coverage|Exclusions|
|---|---|
|A maximum of 50% of property rebuild costs will be covered to assist households to meet minimum housing standards after a hazardous event.|Damage to non-housing related items such as vehicles.|
|Temporary relocation is provided if the building is deemed unsafe for living. Up to 3 months of temporary relocation will be covered.|Only accommodation and basic necessities are strictly covered. No further benefits such as travel expenses are provided as part of the relocation package.|
|Replacing home contents.|Damage to home contents caused by wear and tear, rust, corrosion, or any form of deterioration.|


### Section 1.3: Incentives to Encourage Voluntary Relocation
Voluntary relocation saves an individual from experiencing a hazard event, especially the unforeseen costs associated with a hazard event, such as localized inflation. This report focuses on quantifiable costs, such as property damage but we recognize the significant emotional trauma a hazard event causes. Historical hazard events are bucketed into 3 categories; major, medium, and minor. The thresholds chosen for each region for major, medium, and minor events are detailed in Appendix 1.1.  

Given major hazard events have the highest government cost burden in terms of emergency relocation costs and property damage, moving individuals out of the path of major hazard events will reduce the long-term costs of the CCNSP, and most importantly, reduce the fatality rate of hazard events. Based on our risk analysis, regions 1 and 6 are the least susceptible to major hazard events (see Figure 1.1). We propose to encourage citizens of regions 2, 3, 4 and 5 (‘high-risk’ regions) to move into regions 1 and 6 (‘low-risk’ regions).

## Pricing and Costs

## Assumptions
### Section 3.1 Macroeconomic Assumptions
| Assumption  | Rationale - Proxy Rate |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Storslysia’s short-term inflation (i.e., first 5 years) is 3.00% p.a. on average.  | US Michigan 5-year Inflation Expectations as of March 2023 was 2.80% p.a.   |
| Storslysia’s long-term inflation (i.e., beyond 5 years) is 2.00% p.a. | US Federal Reserve’s inflation target is 2.00% p.a.  |
| Storslysia’s housing price growth is 5.00% p.a.  | Historical average growth rate of US house prices from 1992 to 2022 is 5.40% (CEIC, 2022)  |
| The discount rate applied to present-value calculations is 5.00% p.a.  | Long-term average US 30-year treasury yield is 4.76% p.a. |

### Section 3.2 Relocation Assumptions
| Assumption  | Rationale/ Limitations/ Implication |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| All households relocating from regions 2, 3, 4, and 5 will purchase a property as opposed to rent. | CCNSP will only subsidize households who buy property, hence there are no benefits associated with relocating and renting in regions 1 and 6.  |
| All inter-region migrations are voluntary relocations brought on by climate risk.| A limitation to this assumption is that voluntary relocations are often attributed to other socioeconomic factors such as income, employment, housing and education. |
| Terminal population growth rate accounts for immigration and emigration.| The rates were derived from the census data provided in case specifications which would account for these movements.  |
| Constant annual relocation rate of 0.05% p.a. of regions 2, 3, 4, and 5’s population. | This is assumption is tested in Section 5. |
| Of the population relocating, 70% will move to region 1 and 30% to region 6.  | Compared to region 6, region 1 has higher median income and lower unemployment rates making it more attractive to the labour force. See Appendix 3.1 for details.  |
| Storm-proofing regions 1 and 6 will reduce total property damage in major, medium, and minor hazard events by 50%, 70% and 90% respectively.  | Storm-proofing houses can significantly reduce property damage caused by hazard events as it addresses vulnerable points, improves structural integrity and water management, and prevents damage escalation. |
| Households voluntarily relocating to regions 1 & 6 move into storm-resilient homes.  | Hence, the reduction to property damage forecasts from storm-proofing will apply to all houses (both existing and new) in regions 1 & 6.  |
| The effectiveness of storm-proofing homes in preventing property damage will remain constant over time.  | Citizens act rationally and will replace damaged reinforcements, regardless of severity. This means at all points in time, houses in regions 1 & 6 will always be disaster resilient.  |

### Section 3.3 Case Specifications Assumptions 
* Material and labour costs associated with housing and relocation increase between 0 to 50% after weather events. 
* Cost of replacing home contents ranges from 40 to 75% of temporary housing costs.
* Exchange rate is 1 USD = 1.321 Ꝕ.
