# Climate Change National Safety Plan (CCNSP) - Storslysia Relocation Social Insurance Program
## Executive Summary
Our consulting firm has been hired to design a social insurance program for all residents of Storslysia, who are being affected by catastrophic weather events that are occurring with increased frequency as a result of climate change. This social insurance program called “Climate Change National Safety Plan (CCNSP)”, considers both voluntary relocation and involuntary displacement where: 

* Voluntary relocation is proactive relocation with residents moving out of regions that have been identified as having a high level of exposure to hazardous weather events in advance of catastrophic weather events. 
* Involuntary, or “emergency” displacement is reactive relocation caused by the occurrence of hazardous weather events. 
The program aims to reduce economic costs associated with relocation activities caused by disastrous weather events and ensure costs do not exceed 10% of Storslysia’s gross domestic product (GDP) each year.  

This report discusses the details of the CCNSP, namely: 
1. Descriptions of key features of the designed insurance program, particularly: 
    * Claim process;
    * Requirements for successful claim assessments for the population of Storslysia; 
    * Coverages provided by the program; 
    * Key metrics to be used to report and monitor the success of the program. 
2. Pricing and costs associated with the insurance program. 
3. Relevant assumptions used for analyses and financial modelling.  
4. Risks and risk mitigation strategies. 
5. Data limitations. 

This report will not be discussing the sources of funding or modelling for funding, as they will be covered separately by another taskforce from Storslysia’s government. 

## Section 1: Product Design
### Section 1.1: Claim Requirements
For a citizen of Storslysia to file a claim under Climate Change National Safety Plan (CCNSP), they must satisfy the following criteria:
* Have a permanent address in a region affected by the weather event.
* Be over the age of 18.
* Have quantifiable damage to the property and/or household goods.

The claim will be filed through the CCNSP webpage as part of the government website and the following details will be required from the claimant:  full name; age; address; number of household members; resident type (owner-occupied property or rental tenant); income of primary member; identification documents which clearly shows residential address; current market value of property; value of property damage with substantiation documents provided.
