# Climate Change National Safety Plan (CCNSP) - Storslysia Relocation Social Insurance Program
## Executive Summary
Our consulting firm has been hired to design a social insurance program for all residents of Storslysia, who are being affected by catastrophic weather events that are occurring with increased frequency as a result of climate change. This social insurance program called “Climate Change National Safety Plan (CCNSP)”, considers both voluntary relocation and involuntary displacement where: 

* Voluntary relocation is proactive relocation with residents moving out of regions that have been identified as having a high level of exposure to hazardous weather events in advance of catastrophic weather events. 
* Involuntary, or “emergency” displacement is reactive relocation caused by the occurrence of hazardous weather events. 
The program aims to reduce economic costs associated with relocation activities caused by disastrous weather events and ensure costs do not exceed 10% of Storslysia’s gross domestic product (GDP) each year.  

This report discusses the details of the CCNSP, namely: 
1. Descriptions of key features of the designed insurance program, particularly: 
    * Claim process;
    * Requirements for successful claim assessments for the population of Storslysia; 
    * Coverages provided by the program; 
    * Key metrics to be used to report and monitor the success of the program. 
2. Pricing and costs associated with the insurance program. 
3. Relevant assumptions used for analyses and financial modelling.  
4. Risks and risk mitigation strategies. 
5. Data limitations. 

This report will not be discussing the sources of funding or modelling for funding, as they will be covered separately by another taskforce from Storslysia’s government. 

## Section 1: Product Design
### Section 1.1: Claim Requirements
For a citizen of Storslysia to file a claim under Climate Change National Safety Plan (CCNSP), they must satisfy the following criteria:
* Have a permanent address in a region affected by the weather event.
* Be over the age of 18.
* Have quantifiable damage to the property and/or household goods.

The claim will be filed through the CCNSP webpage as part of the government website and the following details will be required from the claimant:  full name; age; address; number of household members; resident type (owner-occupied property or rental tenant); income of primary member; identification documents which clearly shows residential address; current market value of property; value of property damage with substantiation documents provided.

### Section 1.2: Coverages Provided Under the Program
In the event of a claim, provided an individual satisfies the above criteria, the following benefits and exclusions apply.

|Benefits/Coverage|Exclusions|
|---|---|
|A maximum of 50% of property rebuild costs will be covered to assist households to meet minimum housing standards after a hazardous event.|Damage to non-housing related items such as vehicles.|
|Temporary relocation is provided if the building is deemed unsafe for living. Up to 3 months of temporary relocation will be covered.|Only accommodation and basic necessities are strictly covered. No further benefits such as travel expenses are provided as part of the relocation package.|
|Replacing home contents.|Damage to home contents caused by wear and tear, rust, corrosion, or any form of deterioration.|


### Section 1.3: Incentives to Encourage Voluntary Relocation
Voluntary relocation saves an individual from experiencing a hazard event, especially the unforeseen costs associated with a hazard event, such as localized inflation. This report focuses on quantifiable costs, such as property damage but we recognize the significant emotional trauma a hazard event causes. Historical hazard events are bucketed into 3 categories; major, medium, and minor. The thresholds chosen for each region for major, medium, and minor events are detailed in Appendix 1.1.  

Given major hazard events have the highest government cost burden in terms of emergency relocation costs and property damage, moving individuals out of the path of major hazard events will reduce the long-term costs of the CCNSP, and most importantly, reduce the fatality rate of hazard events. Based on our risk analysis, regions 1 and 6 are the least susceptible to major hazard events (see Figure 1.1). We propose to encourage citizens of regions 2, 3, 4 and 5 (‘high-risk’ regions) to move into regions 1 and 6 (‘low-risk’ regions).

</p>
To encourage voluntary relocation for current home-owners in high-risk regions, a subsidy will be provided towards the cost of the new home in low-risk regions. The average home deposit for first home buyers of 7% will be used as a proxy for Storslysia (Holzhauer, 2022). The subsidy will be a percentage of the new property value in the low-risk regions, to help home-owners cover the down payment for their new property. Given the median house price and hazard risk are different among the high-risk regions, the subsidy provided to the citizens of regions 2, 3, 4 and 5 varies, see Table 1.1. Region 2 has a high severity and frequency of major hazard events, see Table 2.1 and therefore a higher subsidy is provided to encourage relocation compared to regions 3, 4 and 5.

</p>
<p align="center">
   <i>Table 1.1: Amount subsidised of new property value.</i>
</p>

For citizens in regions 1 and 6, a one-off lump sum payment of Ꝕ10 000 is provided to storm proof their houses. Disaster resilient houses can prevent the loss of lives and homes, limit property damage and the need for temporary shelters. A major barrier for households to implement disaster prevention measures is the cost (Owen-Burge, 2021). The program’s one-off lump sum payment will alleviate this financial barrier leading to safer homes. The payment amount is based on storm protection as we project the target regions, 1 and 6, will mainly face severe storms, storms, and hurricanes. According to Forbes (2012), the cost for a household to reinforce their windows, garages, doors, and roof is around $8 000 USD. Based on this research and the exchange rate of 1 USD = Ꝕ1.321, our lump sum value will be Ꝕ10 000. Note this payment must be used only for storm proofing purposes not for general maintenance.

### Section 1.4: Program Justification and Monitoring
The CCNSP also considered resistance to relocation when determining the monetary incentives for voluntary relocations, providing higher subsidy percentages in regions we expect higher resistance. A region’s willingness to relocate was quantified based on the age distribution of the region, percentage of owner-occupied housing units, percentage in poverty and median household income (see Appendix 1.2). We expect young to middle-aged adults, individuals looking for work and renters are more willing to relocate (King, Bird, Haynes, Boon, Cottrell, Millar, Okada, Box, Keogh & Thomas, 2014).

Citizens in regions 2 and 5 have been the most affected by past hazard events. In 2016, region 2 experienced a hurricane causing Ꝕ2.25 billion worth of damage. The costliest hazard event occurred in 1989 in region 5, with Ꝕ3.1 billion worth of damage. These regions require the most targeted relocation strategies, on top of the monetary incentives provided by the subsidy. We propose implementing a marketing campaign also to encourage the take-up of voluntary relocation.  

To ensure the adequacy of the CCNSP, there should be regular monitoring and valuations conducted by an independent agency within the Storslysia Government. Every 6 months a full valuation of all assumptions listed in Section 4 should be undertaken with updated data. As the program is rolled out into the regions, the up-take of voluntary relocation must also be monitored. If any trends emerge, these should be reflected in the relocation rates between high-risk and low-risk regions during the semi-annual valuations. Note, monthly monitoring should still be performed outside of the formal semi-annual valuations to avoid unforeseen trends during valuation months. Given the ever-changing nature of the climate and hazard events, any new data from technological developments such as more accurate catastrophe modelling should be used where appropriate. 

The CCNSP should be evaluated against the following criteria to ensure the program remains solvent and beneficial to Storslysia.
* Costs do not exceed 10% of the GDP, per year. 
* Loss ratio remains under 100%, with a target of 80%.
* Citizen happiness metric, for citizens who have voluntarily relocated, longitudinal survey should be established to track overall well-being.
* Tracking the amount of the up-front lump-sum payment cost recovered each reporting period.

In the CCNSP’s initial phase, the above evaluation should be performed every 6 months for the first 2 years, then every year subsequently to ensure the program remains financially viable from a government perspective. This evaluation is separate from the semi-annual valuations, which is an overhaul of the program’s assumptions and key inputs.

### Section 1.5: Ethical Considerations
Our main ethical considerations when designing the CCNSP include ensuring the program is inclusive, accessible, transparent and sustainable, and citizens are informed decision-makers.

The voluntary relocation benefits and emergency relocation covers apply to all Storslysia residents, regardless of their age, race, gender, religion, and other socioeconomic and individual characteristics. While demographic patterns were used to determine the likelihood of relocation and thus subsidy percentages, the payout of voluntary incentives is not based on individual characteristics. Rather, they are distributed equitably within regions.

To ensure transparency of the claims process, the claim requirements, coverage, and benefits will be clearly documented on the CCNSP webpage where residents make claims. To ensure the sustainability of CCNSP, we considered the long-term financial and social impact. Recognising voluntary relocation induces the risk of psycho-socio-cultural impoverishment (UNHCR, 2014), the CCNSP will monitor voluntarily relocated citizens to ensure they are not worse off (see Section 1.4). Financial sustainability is considered in Sections 2 and 4.

While the CCNSP encourages voluntary relocation, under the ethical framework of libertarianism, social insurance programs should not infringe on individuals’ and families’ freedom to make their own choices. As such, Storslysia’s Government will respect the decisions of individuals to stay. To create awareness amongst residents about the risks and benefits of staying vs. relocating, we propose implementing an education program. This program would detail key information including climate-related risks, disaster proofing homes, essential considerations before moving and where to find support after moving. Hence, the program would abide by the ethical principle of autonomy and enable residents to make informed decisions. 

## Section 2: Pricing and Costs
The CCNSP encourages voluntary relocation to regions 1 and 6 as they are subject to less severe and less frequent major hazard events. As mentioned in section 2, to encourage Storslysia citizens to relocate, a portion of the cost of the new property is covered by a subsidy and a lump-sum payment given to citizens of regions 1 and 6 to storm proof their houses. Our theoretical reasoning towards long-term cost saving is fewer citizens will be exposed to major hazard events in high-risk regions, saving costs to property damage/household goods and temporary relocation which are all subject to localized inflation following major hazard events. The following analysis is reported under baseline assumptions, see Appendix 2.1.

### Section 2.1: Economic Costs of the CCNSP
From our projections, the CCNSP will have a large set-up cost stemming from the lump sum payment provided to existing citizens of regions 1 and 6. From Figure 2.1, the main drivers of costs are temporary relocation costs due to immediate displacement and localized inflation present after hazard events. The cost of the subsidy over time is minor, averaging 0.7% per year of the total cost of the CCNSP. 

<p align="center">
  <img width="460" height="300" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113427890/230577517-e9d5cfb5-2938-40c0-b630-325421514102.png">
</p>
<p align="center">
   <i> Figure 2.1: Historical property damage from major hazard events.</i>
</p>

Without the CCNSP, the lump sum and subsidy payments are not borne by the government but at the cost of greater property damage, emergency relocation and housing content costs. From Figure 2.2, the cost saving of the CCNSP is clear, specifically through temporary relocation costs. The main drivers of the lowered temporary relocation costs are regions 2 and 3. These regions have the highest risk of major hazard events occurring, see Table 2.1, with region 2 having the highest historical average property damage for major hazard events. Further, regions 2 and 3 have relatively higher density compared to regions 4 and 5, with more individuals affected by a hazard event, causing greater emergency relocation costs.

</p>

### Section 2.2: Economic Capital
Section 4.3 of this report performed sensitivity analysis with changing assumptions finding costs are more sensitive to CO2 emissions (IPCC’s SSP Scenarios) and post hazard event price surges. To determine an economic capital amount which maintains CCNSP solvency within a high degree of certainty we apply the extreme limits of these assumptions; SSP-Baseline/Very High Emissions, 50% price increase in material/labour costs after hazard events and household goods cost at 75% of housing cost. Under the extreme limits, over the next 30 years, the average total economic cost of the CCNSP as a percentage of GDP is 0.45%. Therefore, the economic capital needed for the program to remain solvent with a high degree of certainty is 0.45% of Storlysia’s GDP, per year. 

## Assumptions
### Section 3.1 Macroeconomic Assumptions
| Assumption  | Rationale - Proxy Rate |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Storslysia’s short-term inflation (i.e., first 5 years) is 3.00% p.a. on average.  | US Michigan 5-year Inflation Expectations as of March 2023 was 2.80% p.a.   |
| Storslysia’s long-term inflation (i.e., beyond 5 years) is 2.00% p.a. | US Federal Reserve’s inflation target is 2.00% p.a.  |
| Storslysia’s housing price growth is 5.00% p.a.  | Historical average growth rate of US house prices from 1992 to 2022 is 5.40% (CEIC, 2022)  |
| The discount rate applied to present-value calculations is 5.00% p.a.  | Long-term average US 30-year treasury yield is 4.76% p.a. |

### Section 3.2 Relocation Assumptions
| Assumption  | Rationale/ Limitations/ Implication |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| All households relocating from regions 2, 3, 4, and 5 will purchase a property as opposed to rent. | CCNSP will only subsidize households who buy property, hence there are no benefits associated with relocating and renting in regions 1 and 6.  |
| All inter-region migrations are voluntary relocations brought on by climate risk.| A limitation to this assumption is that voluntary relocations are often attributed to other socioeconomic factors such as income, employment, housing and education. |
| Terminal population growth rate accounts for immigration and emigration.| The rates were derived from the census data provided in case specifications which would account for these movements.  |
| Constant annual relocation rate of 0.05% p.a. of regions 2, 3, 4, and 5’s population. | This is assumption is tested in Section 5. |
| Of the population relocating, 70% will move to region 1 and 30% to region 6.  | Compared to region 6, region 1 has higher median income and lower unemployment rates making it more attractive to the labour force. See Appendix 3.1 for details.  |
| Storm-proofing regions 1 and 6 will reduce total property damage in major, medium, and minor hazard events by 50%, 70% and 90% respectively.  | Storm-proofing houses can significantly reduce property damage caused by hazard events as it addresses vulnerable points, improves structural integrity and water management, and prevents damage escalation. |
| Households voluntarily relocating to regions 1 & 6 move into storm-resilient homes.  | Hence, the reduction to property damage forecasts from storm-proofing will apply to all houses (both existing and new) in regions 1 & 6.  |
| The effectiveness of storm-proofing homes in preventing property damage will remain constant over time.  | Citizens act rationally and will replace damaged reinforcements, regardless of severity. This means at all points in time, houses in regions 1 & 6 will always be disaster resilient.  |

### Section 3.3 Case Specifications Assumptions 
* Material and labour costs associated with housing and relocation increase between 0 to 50% after weather events. 
* Cost of replacing home contents ranges from 40 to 75% of temporary housing costs.
* Exchange rate is 1 USD = 1.321 Ꝕ.

### Appendix 1.2: Quantification of Willingness to Relocate

Based on external research (King et. al., 2014) on demographic factors that influence whether an individual relocates, our model considers the following:
| Factor  | Implication | Justification |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------|
| Age distribution  |Older individuals are less likely to move. | Emotional ties to the region. |
| Percentage of owner-occupied housing units | Homeowners are less likely to move.  | Financial commitment to the region. |
| Percentage in poverty  | Individuals in poverty are more likely to move.  | Livelihood opportunities in other regions.  |
| Median household income  | Individuals with lower income are more likely to move.  | Livelihood opportunities in other regions.  |

Using the provided demographic data, these factors were ranked, where a higher number represented the region was more likely to move (Table A.1.2). The sum of the individual rankings was used as the final likelihood measure. Region 2 is significantly less likely to move. Thus, a greater financial incentive is provided to region 2 to encourage relocation. A weighted sum was used to quantify likelihood including the subsidies. The subsidies were weighted 2 as it is a financial incentive rather than demographic pattern. With the subsidy, while region 2 remains one of the least likely regions to move, the gap has been closed. 

|   | Region 2 | Region 3 | Region 4 | Region 5 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |  
| Population Aged 65 And Over (%)  | 26.10%  | 13.70%  | 20.90%  | 17.20%  |
| Likelihood Ranking | 1 | 4  | 2  | 3  |
| Owner-Occupied Housing Units (%) | 73.80%  | 59.80% | 67.20%  | 64.50%  |
| Likelihood Ranking  | 1 | 4 | 2  | 3  |
| Population In Poverty (%)  | 12.80%  | 16.0%  | 19.10%  | 20.50%  |
| Likelihood Ranking  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
| Median Household Income (Ꝕ)  | 68,123  | 71,916  | 48,615  | 61,518  |
| Likelihood Ranking | 2  | 1  | 4  | 3  |
| Final Likelihood Not Considering Subsidy  | 5  | 11 | 11 | 13  |
| Subsidy On Property Value (%)  | 5% | 3%  | 2%  | 3%  |
| Likelihood Ranking  | 4 | 2  | 1  | 2  |
| Weighted Likelihood  | 13  | 15 | 13 | 17  |
